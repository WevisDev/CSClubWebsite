        <p class="card-content">I'm Devin. Yeah, I like coding things. I guess game dev is what I like doing most right now. Ima be honest idk what else to put here, so Ima just drop a game I made rly quickly to fill space. It's literally a flappy bird clone. Yes, my itch name is WevisDev idk everything else was taken. So I guess you can follow my itch, but idk how much I'll upload. Also, CS Club's been really fun so far and I like the projects that we work on as a club like this website.</p>
